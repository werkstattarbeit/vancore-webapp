Data Security

</p>
<p class="copy_s">
Access to the Vancore website or electronic contact or communication normally involves the transmission of user data via a public, universally accessible network. In addition, data may be transmitted across national borders, even if both the sender and recipient are located in the same country. While individual data packets may be transmitted in encrypted form, the identity of both sender and recipient remains unencrypted. Thus it cannot be ruled out that third parties may be able to view data sent in this way and that it may be possible to deduce that there has been contact with Vancore. This means that any confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. The use of electronic media such as the internet and e-mail brings with it the danger of viruses and targeted attacks by hackers. To prevent viruses from infecting your computer, you should always use a current browser version as well as constantly updated anti-virus software. You should not open e-mails of unknown origin or attachments that you are not expecting.
